# Webarchitects Firefox Ansible Role

[![pipeline status](https://git.coop/webarch/firefox/badges/main/pipeline.svg)](https://git.coop/webarch/firefox/-/commits/main)

This is an Ansible role for installing and updating multiple Firefox versions on x86_64 and i386 Debian and Ubuntu GNU/Linux, by default the [Mozilla apt repo is used for Firefox Nightly](https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/2023/10/30/introducing-mozillas-firefox-nightly-deb-packages-for-debian-based-linux-distributions/) and binaries are downloaded and installed for the latest, beat and developer edition.

## Usage

This role configures the [Mozillaâ€™s Firefox Nightly apt repo](https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/2023/10/30/introducing-mozillas-firefox-nightly-deb-packages-for-debian-based-linux-distributions/) and for other Firefox versions it works by:

1. Installing the [Mozilla Software Releases GPG key](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2023/05/11/updated-gpg-key-for-signing-firefox-releases/).
2. Loading the [Firefox versions JSON](https://product-details.mozilla.org/1.0/firefox_versions.json).
3. Checking the locally installed version and if the latest available version is newer then:
   - Downloading Firefox and the GPG signature.
   - Verifying the downloaded files using the GPG signature.
   - Installing Firefox in `/opt`, adding a script to launch it in `/usr/local/bin` and creating a `.desktop` file in `/usr/share/applications`.

The suggested method for using this role is via the [localhost repo](https://git.coop/webarch/localhost) which contains a [firefox.sh](https://git.coop/webarch/localhost/-/blob/main/firefox.sh) script that will download this role and run it, for example:

```bash
git clone https://git.coop/webarch/localhost.git
cd localhost
./firefox.sh
```

## Role variables
